<br><br>About <b>ROC::<i>ROI</i></b>
With the launch of ROC only days away, successful TestNet runs & intentional fork repairs, we have shifted our focus to the Core-Operational body behind RedOakCoin, "RedOakIndustries." Orion will be finishing the copyright modification to the ROC-Core while we all begin to prepare for our hard-launch.
<br>
With over two-hundread successfull *Coins in existance, and their co-dependency to Bitcoin, we not only see room for ROC in the Crypto-Community, but we have carefully analyzed the Socio-Cryptographic-Psychlogical nature of what we think makes a successfull coin and a devoted Micro-Community.
<br>
Big words are fun to makeup and use, but here is our OpenSource Analysis through a psychlogical lense. (It is also important to note that <b><i>Orion</i></b> is completing his degree in I/O-Psychology (I wish it did mean Binary-Psychology). I/O-Psych., is Industrial Orgizational Psychology; while Psychlogists put people on 'The Couch' I/O Psychlogists put entire firms on 'The Couch.' They intergrate, learn, analyze, befried, and study all aspects of any company from the inside out. This is often done with the knowledge of only the CEO & Head Board Members. After His/Her three to six month term, all data is passed to a team. What happens next is the opposite of, "Office Space (The Movie)." People are moved to better suit their needs, wishes, desires, and ideal work-enviornment. You can't put an artist in a Data-Entry cubical. After the company is restructred, raises given, employees motivated, customers turned into 'Clients' and the company is made whole, a team will begin work at increasing the 'Financial-Bottom Line.' Google's "Live And Play At Work" structure is the product of brilliant I/O Professionals; some of which Orion has studied under. <b><i>Plebius</i></b> also has a strong background in Marketing Psychology which will complement Orion's I/O Methods with potiential great and intresting success.
<br>
Orion has spent an entire year learning the psychlogical aspect of the Crypto-Community. Plebius has done the same through a Marketing lense. We are not a firm, nor are we to the likes of Carl Jung." However, we plan on bringing, through ROC, the same professionalism, intuitiveness, creativity, devotion, motivation, and efficiany that is called upon for our kind when handling a Fortune-500 Client. 
<br>
We know what makes *Coin Dev's rich; We know what makes Miners' rich; We know what causes Devs., to go broke; We know what leads to distrust and disharmony in a Coin's Micro-Community. We know we all want to make money, but we also know that Orion specially, wants to be apart of something big, something to help change and shape our future. For this we have chosen this structure & set of rules to abide by:
