A Note From Orion:<br>
'On The Progress Of RedOakCoin'<br>
It has been a long and rough rode for us. 6-Months ago I decided I wanted to get my name in the Crypto-World and contribute all that I had to offer. I knew it would be tough, but to be apart of the future is something truely priceless.
<br><br>
After throwing away 4-BlockChains and starting over many times due to the constant updates we have finally found our prime positioning for the time being. On the Dev., side of things, we already have a list several pages long of options and decisions we would like to/and have to make for the future of RedOakCoin. These range from using the KGW to the potiential use of ZeroCoin or CoinJoin, to basic maintence of Transaction Noise Reduction. 
<br><br>
There is still work to be done (3/20/14) if we want to meet our pre-arranged ANN date of March 22nd. I really hope that by the time this is read we will have made our date with Honor, Pride, and Success or will we have delayed the ANN in order to ensure optimal Wallet Releases.
